      The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of
      abstraction. Theclauses that are included in the full version give
      examples and details of how theseaspirations change the way we act as
      software engineering professionals. Without theaspirations, the details
      can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, theaspirations can
      become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and thedetails
      form a cohesive code.
